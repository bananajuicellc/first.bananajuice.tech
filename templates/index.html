  <p>Click the arrow to find out who goes first.

  <p>Have you played a board game but didn't like the recommended way to
  choose the first player? Is your gaming group bored with throwing dice
  to choose? Who Goes First is a new way to choose the first player.

  <p>Open it and get a random card. It could be interactive or have your
  friends tell the best story. Use it to pick the next player, or if you
  don't like it: tap the arrow to get a new card.

  <p>We are working on an app version for iOS and Android! Please subscribe
  to our <a href="http://tinyletter.com/whogoesfirst">mailing list</a> to
  be the first to find out when it is ready.

  <p>Who Goes First is a project of
  <a href="http://www.timswast.com">Timothy</a> and
  <a href="http://swast.net/alexandra/">Alexandra Swast</a> and our
  friends, born out of our love for board games.
