# Adding cards to Who Goes First

Have a new card idea? First, read these guidelines to ensure it fits within the
Who Goes First project.


## Card guidelines

Ensure your idea matches these guidelines before submitting it.


### Cards MUST be appropriate for all ages

Cards MUST be appropriate for all ages. The board game community included people
of all ages and backgrounds, please ensure Who Goes First is safe for everyone
to use.


### Card images MUST be properly licensed

Card images MUST be properly licensed for reuse, allowing for modifications.
Images MUST be clearly documented as licensed [Creative Commons
Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) or another license
that allows Who Goes First the right to modify and redistribute it.


### Card images SHOULD have square dimensions

Card images SHOULD have square dimensions, for example: 64 pixels by 64 pixels
(pixel art), 800 pixels by 800 pixels (photographs), or 4 cm by 4 cm (vector
art). This way, cards will all have a similar layout.


### Cards SHOULD be less than 100 KB

Cards SHOULD be less than 100 KB to be respectful of players' bandwidth and
storage space. Who Goes First needs to work well offline and with spotty
connections.


### Cards SHOULD work on all devices

Cards SHOULD work on all devices. Some cards may be interactive, but they SHOULD
NOT require a specific kind of device to work. This means the card should
respond to both touch events and click events.
